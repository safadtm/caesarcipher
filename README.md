# Caesar Cipher Website

Welcome to the Caesar Cipher Website! This simple web application allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the classic Caesar Cipher technique.

## Overview

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This application provides an intuitive interface for users to input their messages and select a shift value for encryption or decryption.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Input your message and select a shift value to encrypt it.
- **Decryption**: Decrypt a message by entering the encrypted text and the corresponding shift value.
- **Alphabetic Wraparound**: Handles wrapping around the alphabet for shifts beyond 'Z' or 'A'.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and simple design for easy usage.

## Usage

1. **Encrypt a Message**:
   - Enter your plaintext message into the provided input field.
   - Click on the "Encrypt" button to get the encrypted text.

2. **Decrypt a Message**:
   - Input the encrypted text.
   - Click on the "Decrypt" button to reveal the original message.

## Tech Stack

This web application is built using:
- **HTML/CSS**: Structure and styling.
- **JavaScript**: Algorithm implementation for Caesar Cipher.
